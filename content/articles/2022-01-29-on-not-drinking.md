<h2 class="heading font-weight-light">Near the end of June 2021 I stopped drinking alcohol. My wife was pregnant and out of solidarity (and also that it seemed insulting to continue popping beers on the deck with her while she suffered in the heat), I decided I'd abstain.</h2>

## No easy task 

To say I am/was a beer lover and craft nerd connoisseur would be an accurate assessment.

I'd be that guy sniffing the hops and going on about yeast and east coast IPAs and how dank it was.  But in a good way.  Sort of.  I knew my local breweries. I was up on any gossip of new ones coming to my area. I'd tried the latest new beers available, I was on the mailing lists, knmew the spots, ordered during covid, and generally was in the know about what the trends were. I also dabbled in homebrewing for a year or so which mostly involved flooding my kitchen and having 3 carboys of fermenting liquid on the floor at any given time.

Needless to say, I liked beer.  And not in a (completely) unhealthy way. I loved the act. The event of it. The locations, the patios, the sitting in the sun, the knowing what and where were good. I loved the associated food, the socializing, the experimental flights, the ingredients, the yeast. It was total nerdery.

## Feeling better

<h2 class="display-3">But obviously the worst part of drinking any type of alcohol is the hangover.</h2> 

I was getting tired of it. And they were getting worse.  The general trend of IPAs toward higher alcohol and crazy haziness (or my trend toward drinking only IPAs and generally loving higher alcohol, dry hopped and double dry hopped and double or triple IPA styles) was taking a toll. I'd be hung after 2 beers. Sometimes badly hung after 3. It would write off a whole day. 

## Kid(s)

Enter my second son. 

If my very (very) difficult first child (God love him) wasn't a difficult enough experience, adding hangovers to the mix was no help. Trouble was, drinking when you have children is a world renown medicinal necessity. 

Children (again, bless them) are devastating. They lovable and incredible and amazing. But they're difficult.  And man does alcohol help. Every Mom blog on the planet has a "Wine Time" post or meme or quote or some other shit - which while cliche and eye roll inducing, is absolutely, 100% accurate. 

The problem is, having any type of hangover whatsoever obliterates whatever small amount of life force remains intact when you have kids. Having to wake up at 3am (and again at 4, 5, and 6) to a screaming infant or toddler, get a bottle, change a diaper, or WORSE, deal with a sick or incessantly coughing child (for three full months, then another two after that) is exponentially, immeasurably worse when you have a hangover. 

<h2>Just think back to how bad a hangover was when you were single with zero responsibilities.</h2>

So enter (finally, to the point), not drinking.

I'm coming up on a year. It's a bit crazy. The craft beer lover in me has found an actually surprising array of non-alcoholic beers available which has kept me feeling like I'm not actually missing as much. There are more people in my boat apparently as it seems more than a few breweries are opening only to make non alcoholic beer. Their owners have similar stories. They were craft beer lovers in their younger days, then had kids and couldn't be hung all the time (or ever), but still loved beer.
