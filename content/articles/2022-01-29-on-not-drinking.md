<h2 class="heading font-weight-light">Near the end of June 2021 I stopped drinking alcohol. My wife was pregnant and out of solidarity (and also that it seemed insulting to continue popping beers on the deck with her while she suffered in the heat), I decided I'd abstain.</h2>

## No easy task 

To say I am/was a beer lover and craft nerd connoisseur would be an accurate assessment.

I'd be that guy sniffing the hops and going on about yeast and east coast IPAs and how dank it was.  But in a good way.  Sort of.  I knew my local breweries. I was up on any gossip of new ones coming to my area. I'd tried the latest new beers available, I was on the mailing lists, knmew the spots, ordered during covid, and generally was in the know about what the trends were. I also dabbled in homebrewing for a year or so which mostly involved flooding my kitchen and having 3 carboys of fermenting liquid on the floor at any given time.

Needless to say, I liked beer.  And not in a (completely) unhealthy way. I loved the act. The event of it. The locations, the patios, the sitting in the sun, the knowing what and where were good. I loved the associated food, the socializing, the experimental flights, the ingredients, the yeast. It was total nerdery.

## Feeling better

But obviously the worst part of drinking any type of alcohol is the hangover. I was getting tired of it. And they were getting worse.  The general trend of IPAs toward higher alcohol (or my trend toward drinking only IPAs and generally loving higher alcohol, dry hopped and double dry hopped and double or triple IPA styles)
